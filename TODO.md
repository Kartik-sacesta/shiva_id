# CompanyForm Image Display Fix - TODO

## Tasks to Complete:

- [x] Add missing FuseLoading import to CompanyForm.jsx
- [x] Fix image path for fallback upload image (change from `/images/upload.jpg` to proper Vite path)
- [x] Improve image display logic to handle different image states properly
- [x] Clean up validation logic for better image handling
- [ ] Test the image upload functionality
- [ ] Verify images display correctly in both upload and edit modes

## Progress:
- ✅ Added FuseLoading component replacement using CircularProgress
- ✅ Fixed image src logic with better validation (checking for empty strings and null values)
- ✅ Added fallback image path handling with onError event
- ✅ Improved alt text for better accessibility
- ✅ Enhanced console logging for debugging file uploads

## Changes Made:
1. **Import fixes**: Added CircularProgress to imports and created FuseLoading replacement component
2. **Image display logic**: Enhanced the image src logic to handle multiple fallback scenarios
3. **Error handling**: Added onError handler for image loading failures
4. **Path handling**: Updated image path to use relative path first, then fallback to absolute path
5. **Validation**: Improved image validation to check for empty strings and null values

## Next Steps:
- Test the application to verify image upload and display functionality
